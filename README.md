# Rankinger
Rankinger is an application that makes it easier to manage matches. Create your own leagues, join other people's leagues.
Rankinger generates matches when league is filled and takes care of summarizing those struggles.
User is able to rate the leagues. Each user has a guestbook in personal profile.
Good luck and have fun!
